# {{ packageScope}}

## Description

This is a auto-generated custom workspace with [@nrwl/nx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nrwl/nx).

<!-- toc -->
<!-- tocstop -->

---

# Setup

Everything is dockerized and it will run out of the box, without extra hassle.

Remember that `@nrwl/nx` does not run the services in any kind of order whenever you do `run-many` commands, it is strictly dependend on the dependencies of the project and may not work for tasks like seeding or migrating if the packages depend on a specific order.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Proxying Commands to Docker

All the actions should be done inside the container to have proper access to databases and helper services.

CLI script at the root of the repository is helpful in this case, where it proxies the commands in to the container.

```bash
# Start a bash session inside the container
./cli bash
```

## Build

```bash
# build all services
./cli npm run build

# build a single service
./cli npm run build:one ${PACKAGE}

# append --skip-nx-cache for disabling the cache

# build only changed services
./cli npm run affected:build
```

## Lint

```bash
# lint whole project, with prettier first tslint/eslint later
./cli npm run lint

# lint only affected part
./cli npm run affected:lint

# check linting rules
./cli npm run lint:check
```

## Testing

Testing actions of normal `testing`, `coverage`, `watch` mode and `e2e` is accessible by `@nrwl/nx`.

### `@webundsoehne/nx-builders:run` to run jest

```bash
# run the tests for all services
./cli npm run test

# run the tests for a single service
./cli npm run test:one ${PACKAGE}

# run the e2e tests for all services
./cli npm run test:e2e

# run the e2e tests for a single service
./cli npm run test:e2e:one ${PACKAGE}

# run the tests with coverage report for all services
./cli npm run test:cov

# run the tests with coverage report for a single service
./cli npm run test:cov:one ${PACKAGE}

# to run development mode for tests with watch mode in jest
# this is intended to be ran in a one-at-a-time manner, because the output hijacks stdout and is interactive
# a debug port in 9229 will be open
./cli npm run test:dev -- ${PACKAGE}

# to change the debug port
./cli npm run test:dev -- ${PACKAGE} --debug-port 9300

# for running the e2e tests in dev mode
./cli npm run test:dev:e2e -- ${PACKAGE}
```

### `@nrwl/jest` to run jest

```bash
# run the tests for all services
./cli npm run test

# run the tests for a single service
./cli npm run test:one ${PACKAGE}

# run the e2e tests
./cli npm run e2e

# run the e2e tests for a single service
./cli npm run e2e:one ${PACKAGE}
```

## Backend Related

### Seeding

A fresh start requires the seeds to be run and this has to be repeated each time database containers are flushed.

```bash
# run the seeds for all services
./cli npm run backend:seed

# to run seeds for all services
./cli npm run backend:seed:one ${PACKAGE}
```

### Migrations

Migration actions of `run`, `mock-run`, `create`, `generate`, `rollback` is accessible by `@nrwl/nx`.

Migration runner currently only works for backend applications that are utilizing `TypeOrm` as their database adapter.

```bash
# to run migrations for all services
./cli npm run backend:migrate

# to run the migrations for a single service
./cli npm run backend:migrate:one ${PACKAGE}

# to run migrations in mock mode for all services
./cli npm run backend:migrate:mock

# to run the migrations in mock mode for a single service
./cli npm run backend:migrate:mock:one ${PACKAGE}

# to rollback migrations for all services
./cli npm run backend:migrate:rollback

# to rollback the migrations for a single service
./cli npm run backend:migrate:rollback:one ${PACKAGE}

# create migrations for a single service, you have to pass in --args flag for naming it
./cli npm run backend:migrations:create:one -- ${PACKAGE} --args ${MIGRATION_NAME}

# generate migrations for a single service, you have to pass in --args flag for naming it
./cli npm run nx -- migration:generate:generate ${PACKAGE} --args ${MIGRATION_NAME}
```

### Running CLIs

CLIs are accesible by NX. Arguments can be passed through `--args`.

```bash
# to run a cli
./cli npm run backend:command:one -- ${PACKAGE} --args "hello user"
```
